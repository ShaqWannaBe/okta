# okta

Welcome to my Okta repository. This is where I will store the scripts that I write for Okta's API.

The scripts are writting in Python 3 and use environment variables to hide secrets (such as API keys or domains). If you do not plan on sharing your code and have no need to hide secrets, the script will include an area to hard code your variables.
